### Chrome extension boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for creating a Chrome extension. It includes all the essential files and code that you need to get started.

To use this boilerplate, simply unzip it into a directory and open the `manifest.json` file in a text editor. Here, you will need to change the following values:

* `name`: The name of your extension.
* `version`: The version of your extension.
* `description`: A short description of your extension.
* `permissions`: The permissions that your extension needs.
* `content_scripts`: The scripts that your extension will inject into web pages.
* `browser_action`: The icon and popup HTML file for your extension.

Once you have changed the values in the `manifest.json` file, you can build your extension by running the following command in the directory where you unzipped the boilerplate:

```
zip -r my-extension/ chrome/
```

This will create a ZIP file called `my-extension.zip`. You can then load this ZIP file into Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions/` and clicking the "Load unpacked" button.

**Note:** You will need to change the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `chrome/` directory to implement your extension's functionality.

Here are some additional tips for developing Chrome extensions:

* Use the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect web pages and debug your extension.
* Read the Chrome extensions documentation: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/ to learn more about all the features and APIs that are available to you.
* Publish your extension to the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/ so that other users can install it.
